# Pedestrian and Vehicle Instance Segmentation Based on Mask2Former

This project applies Mask2Former to pedestrian and vehicle instance segmentation on the Cityscapes (COCO-style) dataset.

## Description
The project focuses on dataset adaptation, category reduction (80 → 10), and training pipeline setup under limited computational resources. 
ResNet-50 is used as the backbone, and stable convergence is achieved through iterative training and hyperparameter tuning.

## Notes
- Dataset and model weights are not included.
- This repository focuses on engineering practice and training pipeline configuration.

## Acknowledgement
This project is based on Mask2Former.
